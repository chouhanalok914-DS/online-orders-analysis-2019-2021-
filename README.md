Actual vs Plan Comparison across IT areas like Functional, BU Support, Infrastructure, Governance, and Enablement.

Variance Analysis by Country/Region, highlighting major overspending (e.g., USA: +43M) and cost-saving regions.

Business Area-wise Variance, showing where budget control is effective and where improvement is needed (e.g., Infrastructure overspent by 78M).

Monthly Spend Trend Analysis across departments such as R&D, Manufacturing, Services, and Administration.

KPI Cards displaying Total Spend, Actual vs Planned, and Variance Percentages.

🎯 Objective:
To provide an interactive and insightful dashboard for leadership to:

Monitor and manage IT spending.

Identify cost overruns early.

Optimize business area budgets.

Support financial planning and forecasting.

✅ Outcome:
This project demonstrates practical knowledge of Power BI, including data modeling, DAX measures, visual storytelling, and creating executive-level reports. It is suitable for enterprise-level financial or IT departments aiming for efficient spend analysis.
